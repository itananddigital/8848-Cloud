# Git commands 

Hi, I am Anand Mohan. Below are some of the most useful Git commands that I commonly use.

### Create a new branch and check it:

```bash
git branch -M develop

git branch

```

### Check the status 

```bash

git status

```

### Stage all the changes 


```bash

git add .

```

### Commit the changes with a message 

```bash

git commit -m "I have added few lines of code"

```


### Git push code

```bash

git push origin develop

```
