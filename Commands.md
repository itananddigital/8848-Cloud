# Git Commands Cheat Sheet

Hi, I am Anand Mohan. Below are some of the most useful Git commands that I commonly use.

### Create a new branch and switch to it:
```bash
git branch -M develop
```

### Check the current branch:
```bash
git branch
```

### Stage all changes:
```bash
git add .
```

### Commit the changes with a message:
```bash
git commit -m "Added new content to README.md"
```

### Check the status of your code:
```bash
git status
```

---

Feel free to use these commands as a quick reference while working with Git.
